## Notes

You need to estimate story points to make release planning, to make efficient teams in production skills. You can estimate with story points it's better than hours.

Story points are relative while hours are fixed. Maybe your developers are different and the veolocity is relative and depend on the experience of team members. How to estimate hours without assign it?

**Output** (Story points) / Time (Sprint)

The story points are flexible and adaptable. Fibonacci serie is perfect because it's difficult to estimate. Follow the steps:

1. Understand the value. Because requier committed. 
   1. Time
   2. Complexity
   3. Amount of Work
   4. Dependencies
   5. Risk
   6. Uncertainly
4. Define a pivot story to manage as a complexity.
5. Define examples. Practice and iterate.
6. Define a tool to estimate every sprint.
7. Have a poker planning in order to make better the progress of story points.
