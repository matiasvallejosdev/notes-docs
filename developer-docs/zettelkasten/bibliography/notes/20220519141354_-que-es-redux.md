## Notes

### What is the redux pattern?

- Every data of the application is an structure. 
- Every information of the application is storaged in the STORE.
- Store never is modified directly.
- Iteractions of user react to describe what happen.
- The actual value is called STATE.
- A new state is created with the function action called REDUCER.
