Every table has a **primary key**. The primary key is used to identify the data. The primary key is unique. The primary key is used to identify the data.

You could relate tables with **foreign keys**. Foreign keys are used to identify the data. Foreign keys are not unique.

In a one-to-one relationship, one record in a table is associated with one and only one record in another table. For example, in a school database, each student has only one student ID, and each student ID is assigned to only one person.

In a one-to-many relationship, one record in a table can be associated with one or more records in another table. For example, each customer can have many sales orders.

A many-to-many relationship occurs when multiple records in a table are associated with multiple records in another table. For example, a many-to-many relationship exists between customers and products: customers can purchase various products, and products can be purchased by many customers.
