A data structure is a way of representing data in a computer program. It can be useful to think of data structures as a way of organizing data in a way that makes it easy to manipulate and access.

### Vector / Array
Array is a data structure that the elements are represented as a sequence of numbers. The access is constant time. It is also called as a contiguous memory. The search are linear.

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

### Linked List

Linked List is a data structure that the elements are not contiguous because they use nodes to represent the elements. The access is constant time. It is also called as a non-contiguous memory. The search are linear.

### Hash Tables

[What is table hash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LluB6jU-SwY)

Hash tables are a data structure that are used to store data in a key-value pair. The key determinate the position of the element using the function of hash that returns the position of the index memory of the value. The access is constant time.

### Queue and Stack

#### Queue

Queue is a data structure that is used to store data in a FIFO (First In First Out) way. The access is constant time.

#### Stack

Stack is a data structure that is used to store data in a LIFO (Last In First Out) way. The access is constant time.

#### Graphs

Graphs are a data structure that are used to store data in a key-value pair. For example, trees are graphs and the nodes are the leaves of the tree.

#### Heaps

7 Heaps is a data structure that is used to store data based in logic with nodes and edges. The access is constant time.
