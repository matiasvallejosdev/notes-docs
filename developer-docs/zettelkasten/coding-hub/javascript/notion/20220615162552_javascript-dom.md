## Content

Javascript DOM is the way to manage the HTML and CSS in the browser. It has all of the html that represents the page. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.

```javascript
document.getElementById("id");
```
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.

Each node represent a label of the html. The label is the name of the tag. The dom define the follow nodes:

- Document: It's the root of the tree. It's the first node of the tree.
- Element: It's a label of the html.
- Text: It's a text node. It's a node that contains text.
- Attribute: It's is a property of an element.
- Comments: It's a comment node. It's a node that contains a comment.

### Selectors

Methods are the way to use the interface to select document elements and manipulate them adding data, deleting, changing, etc. They are the main way to interact with the DOM.

```javascript

document.getElementById("id");
document.getElementsByClassName("class");
document.getElementsByTagName("tag");
document.querySelector("selector");
document.querySelectorAll("selector");

```

For example if you need to show some error text in order to show a error message in the browser, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const myNode = document.getElementById("error");

if(form.isValid()){
    myNode.classList.remove("form__error--active");
} else {
    myNode.classList.add("form__error--active");
}
```

### Attributes

Attributes are the way to modify the properties of an element of html. For example if you need to move from text to password in order to hide the password, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const myNode = document.getElementById("password");
myNode.setAttribute("type", "password");
```

Every html element has a set of properties that are common to all elements and you can edit it using `node.setAttribute('att', 'modify')`. 

- contenteditable: It's a property that allows you to edit the content of an element.
- dir: It's a property that allows you to define the direction of the text.
- hidden: It's a property that allows you to hide an element.
- style: It's a property that allows you to define the style of an element.
- tabindex: It's a property that allows you to define the tab order of an element.
- tittle: It's a property that allows you to define the title of an element.

### Classlist

Classlist is the way to manage the classes of an element of html. For example if you need to add a class to an element, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const myNode = document.getElementById("id");
myNode.classList.add("class");
```

The methods of classlist are the following:

- add(): It's a method that allows you to add a class to an element.
- remove(): It's a method that allows you to remove a class from an element.
- item(): It's a method that allows you to get a class of an element.
- contains(): It's a method that allows you to check if an element has a class.
- replace(): It's a method that allows you to replace a class of an element.
- toggle(): It's a method that allows you to toggle a class of an element. 

### Content

Content is the way to manipulate the content of an element of html. For example if you need to change the content of an element, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const myNode = document.getElementById("id");
myNode.innerHTML = "New content";
```

The properties of content are the following:

- textContent: It's a property that allows you to get the text of an element. That return all of the text. It's an standard property.
- innerText: It's a property that allows you to get the text of an element. That only visible text. It's unused in most of the browsers.
- innerHTML: It's a property that allows you to get the html of an element. That show the properties.
- outerHTML: It's a property that allows you to get the html of an element. That show the properties and the children.

### Create elements

When you need to create new elements in html you could add new nodes using the document object model. For example if you need to create a new element in the html, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const parentNode = document.getElementById("form__tittle");
const myNode = document.createElement("p");
myNode.appendChild(parentNode);
```

The methods useful to create nodes are:

- createElement(): It's a method that allows you to create a new element.
- createTextNode(): It's a method that allows you to create a new text node.
- createComment(): It's a method that allows you to create a new comment.

The methods useful to modify nodes are: 

- removeChild(): It's a method that allows you to delete a child of an element.
- replaceChild(): It's a method that allows you to replace a child of an element.
- hasChildNodes(): It's a method that allows you to check if an element has children.
