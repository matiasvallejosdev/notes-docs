## Content

If you want to save data in a file for later or send it to another computer over the network, you have to somehow convert these tangles of memory addresses to a description that can be stored or sent. You could send over your entire computer memory along with the address of the value you’re interested in, I suppose, but that doesn’t seem like the best approach.

What we can do is serialize the data. That means it is converted into a flat description. A popular serialization format is called JSON (pronounced “Jason”), which stands for JavaScript Object Notation.

JSON looks similar to JavaScript’s way of writing arrays and objects, with a few restrictions. All property names have to be surrounded by double quotes, and only simple data expressions are allowed—no function calls, bindings, or anything that involves actual computation.

```javascript
{
    "name": Matias,
    "httpStatus": 200
}
```
