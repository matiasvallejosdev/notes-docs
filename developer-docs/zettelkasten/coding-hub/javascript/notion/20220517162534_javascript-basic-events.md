Events are things that happen in the browser — a button being clicked, a page loading, a video playing, etc. — in response to which we can run blocks of code. Event listeners observe specific events and call event handlers, which are blocks of code that run in response to an event firing.

```javascript
// This button is linked to button-user.js
const sumbit = document.querySelector('#sumbit');
sumbit.addEventListener('click', function);
```
