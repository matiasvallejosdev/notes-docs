When we talk about [OOP](../../notion/20220517163213_poo.md) in JavaScript there is no class.Actually it is a prototype based programming. In this programming style, the object encapsulates the properties, i.e., its methods and data, instead of a class. You can add new properties to this object at any time.The core concept in oop is

- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism

### OOP in JavaScript

JavaScript is not a class-based object-oriented language. But it still has ways of using object oriented programming ([OOP](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-javascript-implements-oop/)).

JavaScript is not an object-oriented language, it was not designed to be one, the notion of classes is absolutely not applicable to it. While everything in JS is indeed an object, these objects are different from the ones in Java or C#. In JS, an object is simply a Map data structure with a somewhat sophisticated lookup procedure. That is it, really. And when I say everything is an object, I mean it: even functions are objects. 

The most popular model of OOP is class-based. But as I mentioned, JavaScript isn't a classed-based langauge – it's is a prototype-based langauge.

> A prototype-based language has the notion of a prototypical object, an object used as a template from which to get the initial properties for a new object.

### OOP and JavaScript

First, in class-based OOP, classes and objects are two separate constructs, and objects are always created as instances of classes. Also, there is a distinction between the feature used to define a class (the class syntax itself) and the feature used to instantiate an object (a constructor). In JavaScript, we can and often do create objects without any separate class definition, either using a function or an object literal. This can make working with objects much more lightweight than it is in classical OOP.

Second, although a prototype chain looks like an inheritance hierarchy and behaves like it in some ways, it's different in others. When a subclass is instantiated, a single object is created which combines properties defined in the subclass with properties defined further up the hierarchy. With prototyping, each level of the hierarchy is represented by a separate object, and they are linked together via the `__proto__` property. The prototype chain's behavior is less like inheritance and more like delegation. Delegation is a programming pattern where an object, when asked to perform a task, can perform the task itself or ask another object (its delegate) to perform the task on its behalf. In many ways, delegation is a more flexible way of combining objects than inheritance 

### Prototype-based and Class-based OOP have their advantages and disadvantages

In prototype based programming, there is no need to declare class as pre-planning about the sort of properties required before creating an object.Since no class needs to be made, you can create the object directly. This also offers flexibility; hence, any changes to the objects can easily and quickly be made while they’re being used.

While all these advantages exist in Prototype-based programming, there is a higher risk of incorrectness as abrupt changes can easily be made. Whereas in the Class-based approach, the blueprints layout a plan beforehand, decreasing the chances of bugs arising.

### ES6 Class keyword

With the release of ES6 in 2015, the long-awaited class keyword arrived in JavaScript. It was done as per numerous requests by the community because people were feeling uncomfortable coming from object-oriented languages. But they missed one important point.

> JavaScript is not an object-oriented language. It is a prototype-based language.

All of these issues can be mitigated with JS objects and prototype delegation. JS offers so much more that classes can ever do, yet most developers are blind to it. If you want to truly master JS, you need to embrace its philosophy and move away from dogmatic class-based thinking.

### Class as Template

We use classes in OOP as templates for creating objects. An object is an “instance of a class” and “instantiation” is the creation of an object based on a class. The code is defined in the class but can’t execute unless it is in a live object.

```javascript
// You could define as a function
function Product(_name, _price) 
{   
    const name = _name;  
    const price = _price;
    this.getName = function() {    return name;  };
    this.getPrice = function() {    return price;  };
}

// You could define the same with class name
class Product
{
    constructor(name, price){
        this._name;
        this._price;
    }

    getName() {return this._name};
    getPrice() {return this._price};
}
```
