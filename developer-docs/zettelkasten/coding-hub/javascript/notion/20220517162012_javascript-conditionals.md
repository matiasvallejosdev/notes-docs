[Conditionals](https://www.javascript.com/learn/conditionals) statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run.

Conditional execution is created with the if keyword in JavaScript. In the simple case, we want some code to be executed if, and only if, a certain condition holds

```javascript
let num = 10;
if(num === 10){
  console.log('num is 10')
} // Only if num is 10 will this code run
```

_There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including:_

- “If” statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code. 
- “Else” statements: where if the same condition is false it specifies the execution for a block of code. 
- “Else if” statements: this specifies a new test if the first condition is false.
