JavaScript operators allow us to perform tests, do math, join strings together, and other such things.

- `+`	Addition	`6 + 9`
- `-`	Subtraction	`20 - 15`
- `*`	Multiplication	`3 * 7`
- `/`	Division	`10 / 5`
  
When we are running true/false tests (for example inside conditionals â€” see below) we use comparison operators. For example:

- `===`	Strict equality (is it exactly the same?)	
  
```javascript
5 === 2 + 4 // false
'Chris' === 'Bob' // false
5 === 2 + 3 // true
2 === '2' // false; number versus string
```

- `!==`	Non-equality (is it not the same?)	
```javascript
5 !== 2 + 4 // true
'Chris' !== 'Bob' // true
5 !== 2 + 3 // false
2 !== '2' // true; number versus string
```

- `<`	Less than	
```javascript
6 < 10 // true
20 < 10 // false
```

- `>`	Greater than	
```javascript
6 > 10 // false
20 > 10  // true
```

#### Comparation Operators

Are used to compare two expression that return a boolean value (true or false). It is often used in conditionals and represent the relationship between two values.

#### Logic Operators

Are used to return a result if the condition is true or false, the result is boolean value and can be used in conditionals.

#### Equal = vs == vs ===

|=	|==	|===|
