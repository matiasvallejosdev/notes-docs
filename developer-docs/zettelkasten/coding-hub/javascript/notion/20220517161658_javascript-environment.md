One of the hardest things to learn in programming is not the syntax you need to learn, but how to apply it to solve real world problems. You need to start thinking like a programmer â€” this generally involves looking at descriptions of what your program needs to do.

It always contains bindings that are part of the language standard, and most of the time, it also has bindings that provide ways to interact with the surrounding system.
