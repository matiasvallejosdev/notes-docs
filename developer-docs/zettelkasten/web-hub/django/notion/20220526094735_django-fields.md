Field is an abstract class that represents a database table column. Django uses fields to create the database table (db_type()), to map Python types to database (get_prep_value()) and vice-versa (from_db_value()).

> A field is thus a fundamental piece in different Django APIs, notably, models and querysets.

In [models](20220526095219_django-models.md), a field is instantiated as a class attribute and represents a particular table column, see Models. It has attributes such as null and unique, and methods that Django uses to map the field value to database-specific values.

```python
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    age = models.IntegerField(nullable=True)
```

You have a lot of different [types](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/fields/#model-field-types) of fields that represent an attribute column inner a database table. It is an abstraction class used to define every property and the relatioships between data models in a database. Each field represent an instance of Field class and determine the following things:

* The column type, which tells the database what kind of data to store (e.g. INTEGER, VARCHAR, TEXT).
* The default HTML widget to use when rendering a form field (e.g. `<input type="text">`, `<select>`).
* The minimal validation requirements, used in Djangoâ€™s admin and in automatically-generated forms.
