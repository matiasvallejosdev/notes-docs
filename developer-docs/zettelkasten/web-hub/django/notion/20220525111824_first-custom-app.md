To start a new app you could put whatever you want in your name and you need to add your application in the settings.py.

```
python3 manage.py startapp ${name}
or
django-admin startapp ${name}
```

When you create your own app you need to migrate data to your settings database. It happen when you change models or some configuration. Any time, any place and any where.

```
python manage.py makemigrations

/* Result
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, products, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying products.0001_initial... OK
*/
```

```
python manage.py migrate

/* Result
Migrations for 'products':
  products\migrations\0001_initial.py
    - Create model Product
*/
```

When you create your models you could opearte that models inside of your admin panel. That is a basic model create to manage products. Into admin you need to add your products to the panel stage.

```python
class Product(models.Model):
    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    name = models.TextField(max_length=40, default='Product')    
    description = models.TextField(max_length=250)
    price = models.FloatField();
```

### How create new products with python shell

Another way to create new things or manage your database is using your models via shell command.

```
cd dirdjango
python manage.py shell
```

For this example you could create new products in the project first-django-project.json. That following illustrate your shell.

```
> from products.models import Product
> Product.objects.all() 
> Product.object.create(name="My product name", price=100)
```

### Verify database schema

With migrations complete, we should verify the successful generation of the MySQL tables that weâ€™ve created via our Django models.
