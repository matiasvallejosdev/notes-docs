## Content

To design URLs for an app, you create a Python module called a URLconf. A table of contents for your app, it contains a mapping between URL patterns and Python callback functions. URLconfs also serve to decouple URLs from Python code.

For example, if a user requested the URL “/articles/2005/05/39323/”, Django would call the function news.views.article_detail(request, year=2005, month=5, pk=39323).
