Django is a framework for develop web applications easy and reusable. Because Django was developed in a fast-paced newsroom environment, it was designed to make common web development tasks fast and easy. Here’s an informal overview of how to write a database-driven web app with Django.

To manage python dependencies it's useful to configure a virtual environment. First you need to init new project folder and then you need to setup a new python3 enviroment. The way to initialize a new project it look like this:

```bash
mkdir myProjectName
cd myProjectName
pwd
virtualenv -p python3 . or virutalenv name -p python3
sudo pip3 install django
```

The folder enviroment has the follow strcuture:

- Lib/
- Scripts/
- .gitignore
- pyvenv.cfg

To create a new django project environment you need to exectue the following command:

```
django-admin startproject trydjango .
```

To run some developmet server you could go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ that is the link of server. You could create with the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

It's sync our project settings. You could create databases. To run a database you could run:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

### Project strcutre

The project structure was divded betweem application, default settings and the most important file that is `manage.py`.

### Django Backend

- [Best Way to use Django — REST API](https://medium.com/@timmykko/best-way-to-use-django-rest-api-a4ab3218d1ac)

The best way to use Django for web applications is to use it to build a REST API and use front-end frameworks — React.js, Angular.js, Ember.js, Vue.js — to render your web page, which can be completely independent of Django. 

The arquitecture need to use a REST API to connect your frotend application developed in one framework with your backend application models developed in DJANGO. It look like this.

You could use django to render the frotend but it doesn't have any sense if you compare it with other market frameworks. 

### Settings

[Django Starter Settings](../first-django-project/firstproject/settings.py)

That is the brain of django project and how its work together in a common application. It make the all of the control of django.

- **BASE_DIR:** Django knows the path directory and where it is located in the system environment that was created. It was really nice and important. You could do thing relative to the project insider to the project path.
- **SECRET_KEY:** Every single django project has secret key it's not used to production for security. You don't wanna make it public.
- **DEBUG:** When you live a server you turn it a false. But it's useful to debug server when you are making tests.
- **INSTALLED_APPS:** It's the brain of django. You could build your own apps and put applications to work together. It's a kind of pieces.
- **MIDDLEWARE:** This is who is your request handle and work like securit features.
- **ROOT_URLCONF:** This the urls routing by django.
- **TEMPLATES:** It's the html pages that it's render by django.
- **WSGI_APPLICATION:** It's how to server works.
- **DATABASES:** Django maps databases, you just change your backend. Where is located and some configuration.
- **STATIC_FILES:** Where your storage.

### Installed Apps

A list of strings designating all applications that are enabled in this Django installation. Each string should be a dotted Python path to:

- an application configuration class (preferred), or
- a package containing an application.

Apps are components of a big django project. If am going to use django admin you could acces to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ that give the acces to your login administration installed by default.  You could create your own custom application. Each app it's independent, little pieces and could run very well. 

To create user you could run the following command. That user is located in django database in the component django admin.

```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
The migrate command looks at the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting and creates any necessary database tables according to the database settings in your mysite/settings.py

### Admin Panel

Generating admin sites for your staff or clients to add, change, and delete content is tedious work that doesn’t require much creativity. For that reason, Django entirely automates creation of admin interfaces for models.

> Django was written in a newsroom environment, with a very clear separation between “content publishers” and the “public” site. Site managers use the system to add news stories, events, sports scores, etc., and that content is displayed on the public site. Django solves the problem of creating a unified interface for site administrators to edit content. The admin isn’t intended to be used by site visitors. It’s for site managers.
