A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database table.

**The basics:**

* Each model is a Python class that subclasses **django.db.models.Model**.
* Each attribute of the model represents a database [field](20220526094735_django-fields.md).
* With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access API; see Making queries.

You could create a model inherit from the class models from django.db like the following example:

```python
from django.db import models

class Car(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    brand = models.CharField(max_length=20)
```

The before model look like this in mysql syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Car(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(30),
    brand VARCHAR(20)
)
```

Once you have defined your models, you need to tell Django you’re going to use those models. Do this by editing your settings file and changing the INSTALLED_APPS [settings](../first-django-project/firstproject/settings.py) to add the name of the module that contains your [models.py](../first-django-project/products/models.py).
