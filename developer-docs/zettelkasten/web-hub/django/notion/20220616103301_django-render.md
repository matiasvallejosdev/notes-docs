## Content

Render your page is the way that you take html code and render it to the browser. It's useful to reuse the same code in different places.

Django templates allow you to render content from the database. That is the key of reusable content that is very useful for your website. With that you could use django models to manage your data and render it in the website.

```django html
from .models import Article

def article_list(request):
    a_list = Article.objects.all()
    context = {'article_list': a_list}
    return render(request, 'news/article_list.html', context)
```

You need to map your templates in your settings in order to use them. Because django find the template in the user directory and in the project directory.
