## Content

A view function, or view for short, is a Python function that takes a web request and returns a web response. This response can be the HTML contents of a web page, or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document, or an image . . . or anything, really. 

### Class List View

Django could create automatically views using templates created to support that class. That are the most common use cases of views. 

A base view for displaying a single object. It is not intended to be used directly, but rather as a parent class of the django.views.generic.detail.DetailView or other views representing details of a single object.

You could use:

- ListView
- DetailView
- CreateView
- UpdateView
- DeleteView


```python
from django.utils import timezone
from django.views.generic.detail import DetailView

from articles.models import Article

class ArticleDetailView(DetailView):

    model = Article

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        context['now'] = timezone.now()
        return context
```
