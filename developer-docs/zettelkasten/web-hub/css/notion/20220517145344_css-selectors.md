## Content

CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

This are the way that you can define styles to an html element. You can use classes, labels or property.
You also can combine this types.

```css
.body{
    text-align: left;
    color: #red;
}
```

Universal Selector: Applies to all elements in the
document.

```css
*{}
```

Type Selector: Matches element names.
```css
h1,h2,h3{}
```
Class Selector: Matches an element whose class attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the period (or full stop) symbol.
```css
.card{}
.card p{}
```
ID Selector: Matches an element whose id attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the pound or hash symbol.
```css

```
Child Selector: Matches an element that is a direct child of another.

Descendant Selector: Matches an element that is a descendent of another specified element (not just a direct child of that element).
