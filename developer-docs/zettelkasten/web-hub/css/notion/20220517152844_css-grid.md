## Content

CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns. It has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward. This article will explain all you need to know to get started with page layout. It's useful to boxes inner structures.

You can create a grid with fixed track sizes – using pixels for example. This sets the grid to the specified pixel which fits to the layout you desire. You can also create a grid using flexible sizes with percentages or with the new ```fr``` unit designed for this purpose.

**The common properties of grid layour are:**
- grid-template-rows
- grid-template-columns
- row-gap
- column-gap
- gap
- justify-items
- align-items
- justify-content
- align-content
- grid-template-area

**The common properties of grid items are:**
- grid-column
- grid-row
- justify-self
- align-self

### Grid Tracks

We define rows and columns on our grid with the ```grid-template-columns``` and ```grid-template-rows``` properties. These define grid tracks. A grid track is the space between any two lines on the grid. In the below image you can see a track highlighted – this is the first row track in our grid.

### Grid Lines

It should be noted that when we define a grid we define the grid tracks, not the lines. Grid then gives us numbered lines to use when positioning items. In our three column, two row grid we have four column lines.

So we can position our items on the grid using the ```grid-column``` and ```grid-row``` properties.
