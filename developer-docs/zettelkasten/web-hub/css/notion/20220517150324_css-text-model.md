## Content

This pattern repeats until all the content has been placed in the box. Text content effectively behaves like a series of inline elements, being laid out on lines adjacent to one another, and not creating line breaks until the end of the line is reached, or unless you force a line break manually using the <br> element.

The CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two categories, which we'll look at separately in this article:

- **Font styles:** Properties that affect a text's font, e.g., which font gets applied, its size, and whether it's bold, italic, etc.
- **Text layout styles:** Properties that affect the spacing and other layout features of the text, allowing manipulation of, for example, the space between lines and letters, and how the text is aligned within the content box.

```css
.p{
  font-size: 20px;
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
  color: #333;
  line-height: 1.5;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  text-align: left;
  text-decoration: none;
  text-shadow: none;
}
