## Flexbox 



Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals. It's useful to elements inner boxes.

### Flexbox property

**flex**

The flex CSS shorthand property sets how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container.

### Flexbox Model

When elements are laid out as flex items, they are laid out along two axes:

<img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flex_terms.png" style="height:300px">

- The main axis is the axis running in the direction the flex items are laid out in (for example, as rows across the page, or columns down the page.) The start and end of this axis are called the main start and main end.
- The cross axis is the axis running perpendicular to the direction the flex items are laid out in. The start and end of this axis are called the cross start and cross end.
- The parent element that has display: flex set on it (the ```<section>``` in our example) is called the flex container.
- The items laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex container are called flex items (the ```<article>``` elements in our example).

### Flex Direction

Flexbox provides a property called flex-direction that specifies which direction the main axis runs (which direction the flexbox children are laid out in). By default this is set to row, which causes them to be laid out in a row in the direction your browser's default language works in (left to right, in the case of an English browser).

```css
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-direction: column;
```

### Flex Wrapping

One issue that arises when you have a fixed width or height in your layout is that eventually your flexbox children will overflow their container, breaking the layout. 

```css
  flex-wrap: wrap;
```

We now have multiple rows. Each row has as many flexbox children fitted into it as is sensible. Any overflow is moved down to the next line.

### Flexbox property

The flex CSS shorthand property sets how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container.

- `flex-grow`

The flex-grow CSS property sets the flex grow factor of a flex item's main size.

This property specifies how much of the remaining space in the flex container should be assigned to the item (the flex grow factor).

- `flex-shrink`

The flex-shrink CSS property sets the flex shrink factor of a flex item. If the size of all flex items is larger than the flex container, items shrink to fit according to flex-shrink.

- `flex-basis`

The flex-basis CSS property sets the initial main size of a flex item. It sets the size of the content box unless otherwise set with box-sizing.
