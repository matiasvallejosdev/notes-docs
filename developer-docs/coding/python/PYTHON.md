## Basic Language

Python is a programming language that is used to create programs, libraries, and applications. Python includes a large number of built-in functions and data types. It is also a powerful and easy-to-learn language. Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language.

## Data structures

### Strings

String storage text in a sequence of characters. They are one of the most common data structures in Coding. They have methods to operate on them and depend on the programming language.

### Lists

Lists are like arrays but they could contain more than one type of data. They are one of the most common data structures in Coding. 

### Array and Tuples

Arrays and tuples are one of the most common data structures in Coding. They are used to store a list of data. They storage one type of data. Arrays are dynamic while tuples are static and can't change.

### Dictionaries

Dictonaries are an advantage of Python over other languages. They are used to store a list of data. They storage one type of data. They are dynamic and can change. It's like a javascript object.

They have a lot of benefits in performance because they use a key value pair that uses a hash function to store the data.

### Binary Search Tree

Binary trees are kind of graph structure that is useful to store data and has benefits in performance. They are used to store data in a sorted way.

The performance is usually log(n) because it's a binary tree.

- Better search performance
- Better insertion
- Better deletion
- Same space usage
- Worse access to data

### Linked List

- [Linked List Geek for Geek](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/)

Linked list are a **data structure** that are used to store a sequence of data elements. They use nodes to store the data and each node has a pointer to the next node.

- **Fifo** are a data structure that the first element enter is the first element to be removed.
- **Lifo** are a data structure that the last element enter is the last element to be removed.

You could build simple lists or multidimensional lists. Multi-dimensional lists use two nodes next and before in order to reference two directions.

#### Graphs

Graphs are a **data structure** that are used to store a sequence of data elements. They use nodes to store the data and each node has a pointer to the next node.
