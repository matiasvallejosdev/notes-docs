# Notion

Notion helps users schedule tasks, manage files, save documents, set reminders, keep agendas, and organize their work.
Taking good notes while reading is an important part of success. Most courses require significant reading, and it can be difficult to understand and master the material and do well in class without solid note taking and reading skills.
