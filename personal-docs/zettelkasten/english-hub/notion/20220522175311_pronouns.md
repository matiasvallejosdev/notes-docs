# Prononouns

When we have to introduce any person in a sentence more than once, then repetition of the same name in a single sentence looks unusual, that time we replace all other nouns with a pronoun.

## Structure

Pronouns are short words and function the same as that the noun does in a sentence. It may be functioning at any place in a sentence like the first person, second person, or third person, respectively.

It can function as a subject, object (direct/indirect), place, animal, thing, etc.

Some common pronouns used most commonly in a sentence are- He, She, It, They, We, Us, I, You, Them, anyone, Something, Nobody, etc.

## Usage

The naming word for representing any male person, and for first, second or third person, we use **“He, his, him, himself” as a pronoun.**

**For example,** 

- James, Jonathan, Robert, Andrew, David, Dwane Johnson, etc. – He, his, him, himself respectively.

Similarly, for representing the naming word for a female person, and for the first, second, or third person, the **“She, her, hers, herself”** pronoun is used in a sentence.

**For example,**

- Sara, Stephney, Lisa, Malina, Agatha, Martha, Julia, Abella, Senorita, etc. – She, her, hers, herself respectively.

And for representing any objects or things like tea, coffee, box, chair, shoes, etc. – the pronoun “It, itself” is used in a sentence or a phrase or a clause.

For Plural words or common from gender, more number of persons, places, objects, first and third person, etc. pronouns like **I, you, us, we, they, them, their, theirs, themself, themselves, etc.** can be used in a sentence.
