Time passed and Frankenstein planned to return home but his return was postponed 7 months until he and Henry went on a tour of Ingolstadt.

### Chapter 7

When Frankenstein returned from the tour he found a letter from his father Alphonse, the letter said it informed him about his brother William who had been murdered, the family was walking through the woods when William disappeared, when they found him he had been strangled. Elizabeth was concerned because she had lent him a necklace that belonged to her mother and when they found William he had disappeared which led them to think that this had been the cause of the attack.
Frankenstein returned to Geneva immediately to comfort his family, but coming home after 6 years scared him of all the changes the place might have had, so he decided to stop a few days before arriving in Geneva to let the scenery He was reassured from home, when he arrived in Geneva, he found the city gates closed so he was forced to spend the night in a nearby small town. Frankenstein decided to go to the place where William had been killed, and he observed a storm approaching through the mountains while the fury of the storm passed by the light of a lightning revealed an object in front of him, his enormous stature, the deformity of his appearance let him know that this was the monster he had given life to and that this thing was William's murderer. Frankenstein couldn't tell anyone that the monster had killed William because no one was going to believe him and even if they believed him no one would be able to catch the monster. He decided to remain silent on the matter but when he arrived in Geneva he learned that Justine, a woman who had served the family for many years and was considered a member, was accused of William's murder since the necklace that Elizabeth had lent her was found in her dress.

### Chapter 8

**At the trial Justine was able to explain everything that happened except the necklace**, Frankenstein knew that **the monster had put it on her dress to incriminate her for William's death**. Elizabeeth **sure of Justine's innocence** asked the jury to declare her innocent like Frankenstein but this was not enough. **Justine was found guilty and executed,** Frankenstein now knew that **there were two deaths in her consciousness** but he did not know how he could solve it.

### Chapter 9

Frankenstein's concern for **the situation was noted as his mental health began to deteriorate,** his father believed that this was due to the loss of his brother but Frankenstein could not overcome **his melancholy due to the responsibility he felt for the deaths of William and Justine as well as the emotional state** of her father and Elizabeth.
Neither his family nor his friends could help calm **Frankenstein as neither of them knew the cause of his distress,** none of them knew about **the monster and he couldn't tell them so he had to fix this. only.** Frankenstein **decided to make a trip to Chamounix to escape again.**

### Chapter 10

During a trip to the top of the mountain the monster approached Frankenstein, ready to fight to the death he cursed the beast screaming, however, **the beast asked him to listen to it**. The beast **proclaimed himself a virtuous creature and said that why he should be the hated being one of the most miserable creatures** and how could his creator with whom he has a pact that only the death of one of the two can break**, hate and detest it , Frankenstein refused to listen** to the beast but it demanded that he listen to him, he said that it was his obligation to listen to him and that if he satisfied his demands he would leave humanity and Frankenstein in peace, but that **if he refused he would destroy Frankenstein and all his family**, Frankenstein **accepted out of compassion and curiosity.**

### Chapter 11

**The monster told Frankenstein how his senses** began to develop after he woke up in the laboratory, how **he could not differentiate the 5 senses or between light and dark when he blinked**, just like a newborn.
When **the escape from the laboratory prowled through the forest living** on fences and nuts until one day he found the fire that a man had left, that day **he discovered the utility and the danger of fire although how to create it eluded him**, so he kept the fire to that it did not turn off and be able to heat his nuts in it, when the food was over **he began to wander again until winter came that was when he found a man's cabin in the forest,** when he entered it **the man ran away horrified by His appearance** (by then he did not know his appearance) **he liked the cabin a lot since it was the first refuge he had after the winter**, he left the cabin and **found a small town**, when **he entered the people ran him throwing stones** and chasing him, this caused that the best was afraid of humans, **she kept walking and found a cabin where she could take refuge** but this time she decided to take refuge in a barn near the house from where **she could observe the family that there he and he lived through a hole in the wall**, seeing them made him happy but he didn't want them to know he was there.

### Chapter 12

Over time the monster continued to observe **the Lacey family** and began to notice that **they were sad**, he deduced that **this was due to their poverty but he also noticed that the smallest Happy was the saddest although reason eluded him**. He began shoveling **snow and chopping wood at night so that they would have more time to work in the garden or do other chores.** The family considered this the act of good spirit. By listening to them **the monster learned words like milk, cheese and bread.**
I also noticed that when Feliz read aloud **he was actually looking at symbols that passed for words**, the monster wanted to learn **to communicate so that he could talk with the De Lacey's family and that they would not hate him or fear him because of his horrendous appearance** which he discovered One day when he looked at himself in the reflection of a stream, **he hoped that by talking to them he could win their affection.**

### Chapter 14

Already with **the ability to speak and read the monster understood the stories of the Lacey family** and even showed letters to Frankenstein as proof, **they were a wealthy Parisian family until one day Felix heard of the unjust imprisonment of Muhammadan** (father of Safie the woman brunette) Felix decided to free the man condemned for his religion and that is how he met and fell in love with Safie. **Muhammadan unsure of Felix's loyalty promised him the hand of his daughter**, yet he had other plans in reality.
When the French government discovered **the De Laceys' connection,** they were exiled to Germany, **with this Mohammad told Safie to forget about Felix and return to Turkey**, Safie instead of waiting in Italy decided to travel to Germany with Felix instead. to go back to Turkey.

### Chapter 15

Shortly after discovering **the history of the De Lacey Frankenstein family**, he found **Dr. Frankenstein's diary** in a pocket of one of the raincoats that he had stolen from **the laboratory when he escaped**, when reading it he was horrified with its origins and began to feel even more alone. 

Then when **he decided to seek the company of the De Laceys**, he waited until the father who was blind was alone and came over to speak with him. **He was kind to him but the monster did not express a desire for his company until the others were already at the door**, by which time **Safie had passed out and Felix had chased him away from the house.**

### Chapter 16

After this, the monster wandered through the forests cursing and screaming in anger for his miserable life and at that moment **he decided to declare war against humanity and his creator Frankenstein who had made it so** horrible and unpleasant, it was then that **he started on his way to Geneva where the landscape calmed him down a bit until when he tried to save a girl from a river he was shot**. That wound was what finally made the monster hate everyone. 

**Later on his way to Geneva he found a little boy and he thought that someone so young shouldn't know** how to hate him and he thought of kidnapping him to keep him as his companion but **the boy resisted**, until he shouted that his father **Alphonse Frankenstein was going to make him pay** for That, when he realized the boy's relationship with Frankenstein, **he murdered him and took the necklace that he found very beautiful,** and fled to a nearby barn where he found Justine sleeping. 

It was there that he put **the necklace on Justine's dress so that she would be blamed for her crime**. Having told the story of him the monster made the demand of him**, saying that only someone as horrible as he could love him demanding that Frankenstein** create this companion.

### Chapter 17

Once you said this **Frankenstein and the monster began to debate about the creation of this being**, Frankenstein believed that if he created this other being the monster would have to have a partner to destroy the world but the monster assured him that **if his vices were due to the need for company were satisfied their virtues must spring from having the company of this being**.
That said, **Frankenstein agreed** to create a **woman** for the monster to which the monster added that **he would be watching Frankenstein to see his progress** and take his partner when he was done.

### Chapter 18

**Frankenstein could not fully begin his work on the second monster** due to the displeasure and horror that this produced in him, **his father Alphonse thought that this was because Frankenstein did not want to marry Elizabeth** but he assured him that he loved her and that only he would marry her to which his father suggested an immediate marriage. 

**Frankenstein told him that before he got married he had to make a trip to England** since he knew that when he started working on the second monster **he would not be able to spend time with his family and friends**, with this he started his trip knowing that when he returned from the wedding with Elizabeth would take place.

### Chapter 19

**Frankenstein met up with his old friend Henry and they went on a trip to Scotland where Frankenstein,** still doubtful, went to the **Orkney Islands where he would undertake the project of building** the second monster.
**Frankenstein began his task** and although melancholic for creating the monster's companion, h**e was afraid not knowing the location of the monster and that it would hurt his family**, but it was the feeling of helping his family that kept him working on his project.

### Chapter 20

Frankenstein **almost finished with his second creation** but more and more doubts came to his head, maybe the monster that he created would be independent and would not want to be with the other or **maybe he could reproduce and generate a race of monsters**, so many horrifying possibilities of the which **Frankenstein did not want any responsibility**, the monster silently watched from the window and saw when **Frankenstein determined not to carry out the second creature** tore it apart in the middle of the night. The creature appeared at Frankenstein's apartment but **he did not change his mind**, to which **the monster replied that he would then have revenge** and that he would be present on his wedding day and left.
After this Frankenstein **received a letter from Henry which he asked to see immediately as Henry would be leaving for India soon**. When he finished packing his things and getting rid of the remains of the second monster, **Frankenstein took his boat and went to see Henry,** where he was **engulfed by a great storm.** Giving up Frankenstein at last I can see a small port. Upon anchoring he was greeted by a crowd of **Irish-looking people who took him before the local magistrate**, there he learned that he was charged with **the murder of a man the night before.**

The magistrate **declared him innocent and had him treated**, he also contacted his father to come and take care of him. **Frankenstein with his health still fragile left with his father back to Geneva.**

### Chapter 22

**While resting in France**, **Frankenstein received a letter from Elizabeth** telling him that she loved him but that **if there was another love in her life she would understand and that he should not feel committed to marriage.** Fearful **remembering what the monster told him**, Frankenstein responded to the letter to Elizabeth telling her that **she was the only woman he could love** and that he would marry her as soon as he arrived in Geneva. **The wedding date was set within 10 days**, and as the date rolled on Frankenstein spent the day with a gun and a dagger in case the monster decided to advance the date. **But nothing Frankenstein could have done would have prepared him for the beast's true plans**.
