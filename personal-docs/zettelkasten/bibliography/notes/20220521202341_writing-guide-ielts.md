## Notes

The General Training Writing test is made up of two tasks, Writing Task 1 and Writing Task 2*. The topics in each task are of general interest.*

In Writing Task 1, you will be given a situation where **you will need to write a letter to request information or explain the situation**. You might, for example, be asked to write a letter to suggest how to improve facilities at a library. Examiners will look at your ability to provide general and factual information in relation to the task, express needs, wants, likes and dislikes, as well as opinions, views and complaints. Your letter should be written in a style that matches the situation presented.

Writing Task 2 is a little different. Here, you will be asked to **write an essay in response to a point of view, argument or problem.** For example, you might be asked to write an essay on whether you agree or disagree that serial dramas on TV play an important role in our society. You will be assessed on whether you can provide general factual information, outline a problem, present a solution, justify an opinion or evaluate and challenge ideas, evidence or an argument.

For general training you has two section that you need to spend **20 minutes** and **40 minutes respectively.**
